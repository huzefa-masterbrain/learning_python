what is a collection?
A collection is nice because we can put more than one value in it and carry them all around in one convenient package
we have a bunch of value in a single "variable"
we do this by having more than one place "in" the variable
we have ways of finding the different place in the variable
most of our variables have one value in them when we put a new value in the variable -the old value is overwritten

x=2
x=4
print(x)

a story of two collection....
 * list
 *A linear collection of variable that stay in order

 *Dictionary
 *A "bag" of values , each with its own label

 Dictionaries
 *dictionaries are python's most powerful data collection
 *Dictionaries allow us to do fast database - like operation in python
 *Dictionaries have different names in different language
 *Associative arrays-Perl/php
 *Properties or map or hashmap - java
 *property Bag-c#.net

 Dictionaries
 *list index their entries based on the position in the list
 *Dictionaries are like bags - no order
 *so we index the things we put in the dictionary with a "lookup tag"

 purse = dict()
 purse = ['money'] = 12
 purse = ['candy'] = 3
 purse = ['tissues'] = 75
 print(purse)

 {'money':12 , 'tissues':75 , 'candy':3}
 print (purse['candy'])

 purse['candy']=purse['candy'] + 2
 print(purse)
 {'money':12 , 'tissues':75 , 'candy':5}
