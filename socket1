Representing Simle Strings
*Each character is represented by a number between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory
*We refer to "8 bits of memory as a "byte" of memory-(ie.my disk drive contains 3 tere bytes
(3 Te of memory)
the ord() function tells us the numeric value of ,simple ASCII character

print(ord('H'))
72
print(ord('e'))
101
print(ord('\n'))
10

multi-byte characters
* TO represent the wide range of characters computers must handle we represent characters with more than one byte
UTF-16-Fixed length-Two bytes
UTF-32-Fixed length-Four bytes
UFT-8-1-4 bytes
  *Upwards compatible with ASCII
  *Automatic detection between ASCII and UTF-8

 UTF-8 is recommended practice for encoding data to be exchange between systems
 Python string to bytes

 When we talk to an external resource like a network socket we sends Bytes,so we need to encode
 Python 3 string into a given character encoding when we read data from external resource,
 we must decode it based on the character set so itbis properly represented in pyhon 3 as astring
